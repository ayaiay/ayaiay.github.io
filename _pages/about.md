###### This microsite introduces AIAIAY, a novel approach to music generation and performance through a network of generative agents exchanging symbolic musical information in real time. Inspired by human music co-creation dynamics, where ideas flow in real time among participants, our system facilitates high-level interaction by allowing manipulation of individual agent parameters and the influence of agents’ behaviors on each other. For the AYAIAY performance, three types of generative agents (percussion, harmony, and melody) are interconnected, sharing rhythmic and harmonic information. Trained on diverse musical styles such as Latin Afrodiasporic, classical, and pop, these agents generate individual musical material and mutually affect each other. Musical output and evolution are guided by defining each agent’s style limits, adjusting individual parameters in real time, and managing interconnections between agents. By defining a specific network topology and agent styles, our system is able to generate and transform compelling new musical ideas effortlessly, with features reminiscent of the styles yet from unexplored origins. AYAIAY represents the result to date of an exhaustive ongoing exploration of this network system, offering insights from UX, technological, and aesthetic perspectives. This article details the computational aspects of the agents and network, concluding with a discussion on the potential of this system as a co-creative interactive tool for musical production and improvisation. AYAIAY’s performance involves live performance of the network using MIDI controllers as inputs and an array of sound synthesizers, samplers and effects combined with pre-generated fragments created with the same system.
